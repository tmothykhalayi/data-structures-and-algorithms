# Common Patterns in DSA

## Sliding Window
Used for problems involving arrays or strings where you need to find a contiguous subarray/substring.

**Common use cases:**
- Maximum/minimum sum subarray
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Anagrams in a string

## Two Pointers
Use two pointers to traverse an array or list, often from different positions.

**Common use cases:**
- Pair with target sum
- Remove duplicates
- Palindrome checking

## Fast & Slow Pointers
Two pointers move at different speeds through a data structure.

**Common use cases:**
- Detecting cycles in linked lists
- Finding middle of linked list
- Palindrome linked list

## Merge Intervals
Deal with overlapping intervals.

**Common use cases:**
- Merge overlapping intervals
- Insert interval
- Meeting rooms

## Cyclic Sort
Used when dealing with arrays containing numbers in a given range.

**Common use cases:**
- Find missing number
- Find duplicates
- Find first k missing positive numbers

## In-place Reversal of Linked List
Reverse parts or all of a linked list without using extra space.

**Common use cases:**
- Reverse linked list
- Reverse sublist
- Reverse k-element sublist

## Tree BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Traverse a tree level by level using a queue.

**Common use cases:**
- Level order traversal
- Minimum depth
- Connect level order siblings

## Tree DFS (Depth-First Search)
Traverse a tree using recursion or stack.

**Common use cases:**
- Sum of path numbers
- All paths for a sum
- Count paths for a sum

## Binary Search
Search in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space.

**Common use cases:**
- Search in sorted array
- Find peak element
- Search in rotated array

## Top K Elements
Find top/smallest/most frequent k elements using heap.

**Common use cases:**
- K largest elements
- K closest points
- Top k frequent numbers

## Dynamic Programming
Break down problems into smaller subproblems and store results.

**Common patterns:**
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Unbounded Knapsack
- Fibonacci numbers
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Edit Distance

## Backtracking
Build solutions incrementally and abandon them if they don't satisfy constraints.

**Common use cases:**
- Subsets
- Permutations
- Combination sum
- N-Queens
