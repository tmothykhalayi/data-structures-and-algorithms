# Phase 5: Recursion Patterns

## Welcome to Recursion and Problem-Solving Patterns

Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Combined with common problem-solving patterns, it becomes an essential tool for tackling complex challenges.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. **Advanced Recursion**
- Recursion with multiple branches
- Memoization and caching
- Tail recursion optimization
- Recursion vs iteration trade-offs

### 2. **Divide and Conquer**
- Breaking problems into subproblems
- Merge sort, quick sort
- Binary search tree operations
- Closest pair of points

### 3. **Two Pointers**
- Opposite ends
- Same direction
- Fast and slow pointers
- Applications in arrays and linked lists

### 4. **Sliding Window**
- Fixed-size windows
- Variable-size windows
- Maximum/minimum in subarrays
- Substring problems

### 5. **Greedy Algorithms**
- Making locally optimal choices
- Activity selection
- Huffman coding
- Minimum spanning tree

## Why This Phase Matters

These patterns appear in 80% of coding interview problems:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Quickly identify problem types
2. **Efficiency**: Transform brute force to optimal solutions
3. **Interview Success**: Most problems use these patterns
4. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop systematic thinking

## Interview Tips

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Sorted array → Two pointers or binary search
- Subarray/substring → Sliding window
- All combinations → Backtracking
- Optimization → DP or greedy

**Common Questions**:
- Subsets / Permutations / Combinations
- Two Sum variations
- Longest substring problems
- Jump game series
- Meeting rooms

---

## Practice Strategy

1. **Learn each pattern**: Understand the template
2. **Solve easy problems**: 3-5 per pattern
3. **Solve medium problems**: 7-10 per pattern
4. **Combine patterns**: Some problems use multiple
5. **Time yourself**: Practice under pressure

**Recommended Problem Count**: 30-40 problems across all patterns
