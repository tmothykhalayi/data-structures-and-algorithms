## Why Foundations Matter

Before implementing complex data structures like AVL trees or algorithms like Dijkstra's, you need to:

1. **Understand Complexity**: Know how to measure and compare algorithms
2. **Recognize Patterns**: See common structures in different problems
3. **Build Intuition**: Develop problem-solving instincts
4. **Establish Vocabulary**: Learn to communicate technical concepts

## Study Tips

- **Master the basics**: Don't rush through fundamentals
- **Practice analyzing**: Look at code and determine its time complexity
- **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on why, not just what
- **Use visualization**: Draw diagrams to understand concepts
- **Code along**: Type out examples yourself

## Next Steps

After mastering phase 0, you'll be ready to:
- Implement linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Understand and build tree structures
- Work with hash tables and sets
- Implement core algorithms (searching, sorting)
- Tackle recursion and dynamic programming
- Explore graph algorithms
